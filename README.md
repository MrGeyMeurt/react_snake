# Snake Game in React

## Description

This is a solo student project to recreate the classic Snake game using React, with styling in Sass. The game allows the player to control a snake, eating red dots to grow in size. The game ends if the snake collides with the edges of the board. Future updates are planned to introduce different game modes.

## Features
- **Basic Gameplay**: The player controls a snake that moves across the screen.
- **Growth Mechanic**: The snake grows in length each time it eats a red dot.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake hits the border.
- **Responsive Design**: The game interface is styled with Sass for a responsive and clean look.

## Planned Updates

- **New Game Modes**: Additional modes are planned to enhance gameplay variety.
- **Customization Options**: Options for changing snake speed, colors, or difficulty.
- **Advanced Mechanics**: Possibly adding obstacles, power-ups, or even a multiplayer mode.
